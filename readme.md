This is the directory for all of the programs that I have developed for the Coursera "Interactive Programming in Python" course given by Rice university. I will be continueing this folder when continueing in the certification course.

Note the code is written using a tool developed by the professors and staff at Rice for this course, and is access via web browser by going to:

http://www.codeskulptor.org/

You can then cut and paste in the text of my files. One of these days I'll post in the direct URLs to this readme file for convienance.
